The encapsulation and modularity concepts have been adhered to in the Java code that has been presented above. Encapsulation is a technique in programming that allows the programmer to connect data and the code that manipulates it together into a single unit. This makes it easier for the programmer to debug and maintain the program. The process of dividing a program down into numerous self-contained and independent modules in order to make the code easier to read, comprehend, maintain, and debug is referred to as modularity.

## Explanation:

In order to achieve encapsulation in the code, each class must be declared to be its own independent self-contained unit. Each class comes with its own set of data as well as methods to work with that data. Because this information is marked as private, the only people who are able to access it are the public getters and setters. In the Student class, for instance, the id, name, and grade point average (GPA) variables are all private. Additionally, it possesses public getters and setters that allow users to access and modify the values of the variables in question. The programmer is able to exert control over the data and how it is used as a result of this.

In addition, modularity is accomplished by the code through the creation of standalone classes that may either be combined with one another or utilized independently. Each class was developed to stand on its own and carry out a particular responsibility. For instance, the Student class is in charge of saving a student's information, whereas the Course class is in charge of storing information about a course. Both classes share this responsibility. The Enrollment class is the sole class that interacts with both the Student and the Course classes; however, because it was created in a way that makes it simple to construct an Enrollment object by utilizing existing Student and Course objects, it is the only class that fulfills both of these roles. Because it is modularized, the code is much simpler to read, comprehend, maintain, and troubleshoot.

A class diagram is also utilized within the code in order to create a graphical representation of the code. The classes, their data, and their methods are all represented by the diagram. The code is simplified as a result, making it easier to understand and interpret. In addition to this, it assists in ensuring that the code is well-organized and adheres to the correct design principles.

The code that has been provided adheres to the tenets of encapsulation and modularity, and it has been structured in a way that makes it much simpler to read and keep up to date. A class diagram is also utilized within the code in order to supply a visual representation, assist in ensuring that the code adheres to appropriate design principles, and give clarity. Because of this, the code is simpler and easier to troubleshoot.

In general, the code that was provided adheres to the tenets of encapsulation and modularity, and it is structured in a way that makes it much simpler to read and keep up to date. A class diagram is also utilized within the code in order to supply a visual representation, assist in ensuring that the code adheres to appropriate design principles, and give clarity. Because of this, the code is simpler and easier to troubleshoot. If these standards and concepts are followed, the code will be more effective and dependable.
